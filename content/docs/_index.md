## Objective

**Test** is a Security & Operations Cloud Platform offering real-time detection, analysis, and insights for your cloud environments, repositories, code workflows, or your identity providers. The detection/analysis/insights cover all activities in cloud environments, activities related to changes in your repositories, workflows, or user activities as seen from the identity provider point of view. The platform then offers insights into anomalous events, detections for any potential threats, and also analyses about the usage patterns for the identities in your respective organizations or environments.

As organizations and enterprises spread their digital portfolio footprints, there are multiple different attack surfaces that may potentially lead to data breeches or identity thefts. The cloud and mobile adoption of enterprises coupled with increasing software applications result in increase in attack vectors, adding to the dynamics of complexity of managing security for the associated identities and operations. While these incresing attack surfaces and attack vectors cause high complexity, these also increase the spending on Cybersecurity for the organizations.

**Test** platform is a next-generation centralized security and operations platform powered by unconventional AI/ML models, offering insights/analyses into the trends of your environments and identities, and real-time detection of threats and risks (potential threats) based on historic and runtime data.
